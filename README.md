# Project-1-by-Shay-Rabin
In my first project I used the programming languages HTML, CSS, SASS and BOOTSTRAP.

I'm slowly discovering that I enjoy the logical pan of the back more, but I found it challenging and interesting to complete the tasks.

I hope you'll like it.

# Project 2

This project was very difficult for me due to a personal crisis in my life but in the end I managed it, not in the best way but you can say I finished. 
I find myself still having difficulty in all the java & Type script worlds, so I was not able to invest too much in designs. 
Anyway, I'm glad it's over, I hope you like it, and now it's time to complete material to keep improving.
Thanks,
Shay Rabin
